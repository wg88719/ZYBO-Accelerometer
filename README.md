# ZYBO-Accelerometer

This is a project for the Digilent ZYBO board using Xilinx Vivado and the Xilinx SDK. 

The PmodACL hardware model is under some license that I don't care about and is only slightly modified by me. The original author is Josh Sackos. 

Once again, **I AM NOT THE AUTHOR OF THE PMODACL HARDWARE DESIGN.**

The actual accelerometer software was written by me and is under the LGPL v3.

Keep in mind that the libraries used are NOT free software. However, my code is, so enjoy. 

Also, there are a few files in there that aren't actually needed, they were generated when I ran the design and stuff. You can ignore them.
